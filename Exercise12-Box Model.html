    <h3>Snacks: WHITE CHOCOLATE</h3>
    White chocolate is a chocolate confection, pale ivory in color, made from cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and sometimes vanilla. White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, which are found in other types of chocolate, such as milk chocolate and dark chocolate. It is solid at room temperature 25 °C (77 °F) because the melting point of cocoa butter, the only cocoa bean component of white chocolate, is 35 °C (95 °F).
    White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, the primary non-fat constituent of conventional chocolate liquor — chocolate in its raw, unsweetened form. During manufacturing, the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content, as with milk chocolate and dark chocolate, but, unlike with other forms of chocolate, no cocoa mass is added back; cocoa butter is the only cocoa ingredient in white chocolate. White chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine which are present in the cocoa mass but not the butter. Flavorings such as vanilla may be added to white chocolate confectionery. Caramelized white chocolate is called "blonde chocolate" and has a different flavor profile.

    <h3>Vacation Spot: LAIYA BEACH</h3>
    Laiya Beach, located in Laiya-Aplaya, San Juan, Batangas, is a popular beach destination in the Philippines. Due to the beach's white sands, clear waters, and proximity to the country's capital, Manila, it has become one of the most famous and most visited beaches in the country, particularly for those from the National Capital Region.
    Laiya has white sand beaches and clear waters, and as such is frequently compared to Boracay, which is the country's top beach choice for local tourists, celebrities, and foreign tourists alike. Weathering-formed crushed shells and corals make up both beaches' white sands, with Boracay's being noticeably finer and whiter. Laiya is one of the beaches that have gained popularity recently[when?]; thus, there are not as many luxury resorts and activities in the area as compared to other beaches in the country. It is within driving distance (from two to six hours depending on traffic) from the city of Manila.

    <h3>Movie: I am Legend</h3>
    Robert Neville (Will Smith), a brilliant scientist, is a survivor of a man-made plague that transforms humans into bloodthirsty mutants. He wanders alone through New York City, calling out for other possible survivors, and works on finding a cure for the plague using his own immune blood. Neville knows he is badly outnumbered and the odds are against him, and all the while, the infected wait for him to make a mistake that will deliver Neville into their hands.
